    <h1>All About Pakistan</h1>   
    <p>As a poor offspring of the subcontinent, Pakistan at independence in 1947 inherited a disproportionally small share of its assets, and a larger share of its liabilities; one-fifth of the area and the highways, about one- sixth of the population and railroads, one-seventh of the cultivated land, a tenth of the army, a small minority of the edu­cated middle class, relatively few of the shopkeepers, tradesmen and professional classes, hardly any industrial workers, very few of the known minerals, a small frac­tion of the industrial equipment, only a few mills for the cotton crop, and only one major port: Karachi.
        Jammu and Kashmir and Pakistan
        The separation of the deficit area of Bangladesh in 1971 did strengthen the food situation of the truncated state and re­duced its population problem, but at the same time diminished the revenue base of the export of jute and tea. The two wings of Pakistan were linked by long and costly air-routes across northern India or by the slow sea route of nearly 3,000 miles (4,827 km) around southern India and Sri Lanka.
        ADVERTISEMENTS:
         
        Bangladesh’s secession lifted the burdens imposed by this awkward political geogra­phy from the shoulders of Pakistan. Pakistan’s share of the subcontinent’s re­sources of coal, iron, and other basic materials is insignificant. It has some gas and oil (at Sui fields). Its position in fibers is comparatively strong, and in food grains it has normally good surpluses of wheat.
        
        By geography and by history, Pakistan and India are complementary. Political separation based on the concentrations of Muslims and non-Muslims defy several facts of physical and economic geography. The international borders show little re­gard for the established networks of railroads, irrigation canals and manufactur­ing. India could, if it wishes, gain control over the water of Pakistan’s canals by di­verting water to its own territory, thus virtually choking off Pakistan’s agricul­tural base. (The two countries reached an agreement in 1960, the Indus Waters Treaty, regarding the distribution of wa­ters)</p>
